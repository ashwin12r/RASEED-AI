# **App Name**: Project Raseed

## Core Features:

- Multimodal Receipt Ingestion and Analysis: Receive photos, video, or live stream feeds of receipts in any language. The agent will use Gemini’s multimodal capabilities to instantly analyze the media, determine individual items, extract the value, amount, taxes, and other fees, store this information, and share it as passes that can be added to Google Wallet. The items will be available as text information in the back of the pass (details), and the pass can contain links that will link back to the personal assistant for more information.
- Local Language Query and Pass Generation: Allow users to create requests in their local language (e.g., "What can I cook with the food I bought from the last two weeks?", or “What ingredients do I need to buy to be able to cook this dish?”, or “Do I have enough laundry detergent for my weekly laundry?”). If the response is something that can be added to Google Wallet, such as a shopping list, the agent, built with Vertex AI Agent Builder, should create a pass to be added to Google Wallet with the items listed in the pass details.
- Spending Analysis and Savings Suggestions: Reply to queries about how much the user is spending on different categories (e.g., "How much did I spend on groceries last month?"). The agent will use a Gemini model to analyze spending trends and suggest ways to save money, such as identifying recurring subscriptions or suggesting cheaper alternatives for frequently purchased items. The assistant should share the most relevant insights about the user's finances in a pass that can be added to Google Wallet (e.g., “Your spending is trending up”, or “There’s an opportunity to save on groceries this week”). This pass should be updated whenever there are changes in the user insights, and generating push notifications with the Google Wallet API is a nice addition to the user experience.
- Seamless Google Wallet API Integration: Directly integrate with the Google Wallet API to programmatically create, manage, and push these customized passes to the user's wallet.
- Dynamic Categorization: Dynamically categorize receipts based on vendor, items, and spending patterns using AI.
- Automated Fraud Detection: Employ machine learning models to automatically detect potentially fraudulent receipt submissions.
- Receipt Management for Visually Impaired: Provide accessibility features for visually impaired users to manage and understand their receipts.
- Auto Warranty Tracker: Automatically track warranties based on receipt data.
- Return and Refund Reminder Bot: A bot that reminds users about return and refund deadlines based on purchase dates on receipts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm, reliable blue (#5DADE2), avoiding the cliche of green for money apps. Its familiarity and openness creates a feeling of trust.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#EBF4FA), matching the primary's hue.
- Accent color: A more saturated violet-blue (#488AC2) offers a clean, crisp contrast while remaining within the analogous palette.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral and clean aesthetic.
- Use minimalist line icons to represent different categories of expenses.
- A clean, card-based layout will be used to present the extracted receipt data and spending insights.
- Subtle animations on data refresh and chart updates to enhance user experience.
